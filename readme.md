# Rust Sandbox

This is my Rust "sandbox" project. It's just a project where I play and tinker with Rust. It's mostly for learning purposes. You will find nothing of worth here, I swear!

Repo includes:
1. Example code from Rust Crash Course | Rustlang [https://youtu.be/zF34dRivLOw] --- **NOW IN SRC.OLD1**
2. My Leap Year calculator mini project --- **NOW IN SRC.OLD2**
3. Project following Introduction to Rust with Brooks Builds - Build a CLI Todo App [https://youtu.be/IhvzGzoq4mc] --- **CURRENT PROJECT IN SRC**
